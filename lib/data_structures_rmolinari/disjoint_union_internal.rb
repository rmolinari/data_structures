# A "disjoint set union" that represents a set of elements that belonging to _disjoint_ subsets. Alternatively, this expresses a
# partion of a fixed set.
#
# The data structure provides efficient actions to merge two disjoint subsets, i.e., replace them by their union, and determine if
# two elements are in the same subset.
#
# The elements of the set must be 0, 1, ..., n-1. Client code can map its data to these representatives. The code uses several ideas
# from Tarjan and van Leeuwen for efficiency
#
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure for a good introduction.
