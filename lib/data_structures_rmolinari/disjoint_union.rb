# A "disjoint set union" that represents a set of elements that belonging to _disjoint_ subsets. Alternatively, this expresses a
# partion of a fixed set.
#
# The data structure provides efficient actions to merge two disjoint subsets, i.e., replace them by their union, and determine if
# two elements are in the same subset.
#
# The elements of the set are 0, 1, ..., n-1, where n is the size of the universe. Client code can map its data to these
# representatives.
#
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure for a good introduction.
#
# The code uses several ideas from Tarjan and van Leeuwen for efficiency. We use "union by rank" in +unite+ and path-halving in
# +find+. Together, these make the amortized cost of each opperation effectively constant.

#
# @todo
#   - allow caller to expand the size of the universe. This operation is called "make set".
#     - All we need to do is increase the size of @d, set the parent pointers, define the new ranks (zero), and update @size.
