# Data Structures

This is a small collection of Ruby data structures that I have implemented for my own interest. Implementing the code for a data
structure is almost always more educational than simply reading about it and is usually fun.

These implementations are not particularly clever. They are based on the expository descriptions and pseudo-code I found as I read
about each structure and so are not as fast as possible.

The code is available in gem form: https://rubygems.org/gems/data_structures_rmolinari.

## Usage

The right way to organize the code is not obvious to me. For now the data structures are all defined in the module
`DataStructuresRMolinari` to avoid polluting the global namespace.

Example usage after the gem is installed:
```
require 'data_structures_rmolinari`

# Pull what we need out of the namespace
MaxPrioritySearchTree = DataStructuresRMolinari::MaxPrioritySearchTree
Point = DataStructuresRMolinari::Point # anything responding to :x and :y is fine

pst = MaxPrioritySearchTree.new([Point.new(1, 1)])
puts pst.highest_ne(0, 0) # "Point(1,1)"
```

## Implementations

### Disjoint Union

We represent the set S(n) = {0, 1, ..., n-1} as the disjoint union of subsets. Alternatively, we represent a partition of S(n). The
data structure provides very efficient implementation of the two key operations
- `unite(e, f)`, which merges the subsets containing e and f; and
- `find(e)`, which returns the canonical representative of the subset containing e. Two elements e and f are in the same subset
  exactly when `find(e) == find(f)`.

For more details see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure and the paper by Tarjan and van Leeuwen.[^tarjan]

### Heap

A binary heap with an `update` method, suitable for use as a priority queue. There are several supported operations:
- `insert(item, priority)`, insert the given item with the stated priority.
  - By default, items must be distinct.
- `top`, returning the element with smallest priority
- `pop`, return the element with smallest priority and remove it from the structure
- `update(item, priority)`, update the priority of the given item, which must already be in the heap

`top` is O(1). The others are O(log n) where n is the number of items in the heap.

By default we have a min-heap: the top element is the one with smallest priority. A configuration parameter at construction makes it
a max-heap.

Another configuration parameter allows the creation of a "non-addressable" heap. This makes it impossible to call `update`, but
allows the insertion of duplicate items (which is sometimes useful) and slightly faster operation overall.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap and Edelkamp et al.[^edelkamp]

### Priority Search Tree

A PST stores a set P of two-dimensional points in a way that allows certain queries about P to be answered efficiently. See the
papers McCreight[^mccreight] and De et al.[^de_2011]
- `highest_ne(x0, y0)` and `highest_nw(x0, y0)`, the highest point in the quadrant to the northest/northwest of (x0, y0);
- `leftmost_ne(x0, y0)`, the leftmost point in the quadrant to the northeast of (x0, y0);
- `rightmost_nw(x0, y0)`, the rightmost point in the quadrant to the northwest of (x0, y0);
- `highest_3_sided(x0, x1, y0)`, the highest point in the region specified by x0 <= x <= x1 and y0 <= y; and
- `enumerate_3_sided(x0, x1, y0)`, enumerate all the points in that region.

The single-point queries run in O(log n) time, where n is the size of P, while `enumerate_3_sided` runs in O(m + log n), where m is
the number of points actually enumerated.

The implementation is in `MaxPrioritySearchTree` (MaxPST for short), so called because internally the structure is, among other
things, a max-heap on the y-coordinates.

These queries appear rather abstract at first but there are interesting applications. See, for example, section 4 of
McCreight[^mccreight], keeping in mind that the data structure in that paper is actually a _MinPST_.

Here compass directions are the natural ones in the x-y plane with the positive x-axis pointing east and the positive y-axis
pointing north. "Left", "right", and "highest" mean "west", "east", and "north".  The use of both compass- and spatial-directions is
confusing but comes from the papers. There is an open issue to make this more consistent.

De et al. generalize the structure to a _Min-max Priority Search Tree_ (MinmaxPST) that can also answer queries in the southeast and
southwest quadrants of the query point and in a downwards-infinite box.[^de_2013] (Otherwise we need to either implement a _MinPST_
data structure - which is a duplication of work for the programmer - or create a separate _MaxPST_ with points under the mapping (x,
y) -> (x, -y), which is a duplication of work for the computer.)  But the presentiation is hard to follow in places and the
pseudocode is buggy. See the comments in the fragmentary class `MinMaxPrioritySearchTree` for further details.

### Segment Tree

Segment trees store information related to subintervals of a certain array. For example, they can be used to find the sum of the
elements in an arbitrary subinterval A[i..j] of an array A[0..n] in O(log n) time. Each node in the tree corresponds to a subarray
of A in such a way that the values we store in the nodes can be combined efficiently to determined the desired result for arbitrary
subarrays.

An excellent description of the idea is found at https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html.

There is a generic implementation, `GenericSegmentTree` (perhaps better described as "abstract"), and concrete classes
`MaxValSegmentTree` and `IndexOfMaxValSegmentTree`. The generic implementation is designed so that concrete classes can be written
by providing a handful of simple lambdas and constants to the generic class's initializer. Figuring out the details requires some
knowledge of the internal mechanisms of a segment tree, for which the link at cp-algorithms.com is very helpful. See the definitions
of the concrete classes for examples.
