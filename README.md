# Data Structures

This is a small collection of Ruby data structures that I have implemented for my own interest.  Implementing the code for a data
structure is almost always more educational than simply reading about it and is usually fun.  I wrote some of them while
participating in the Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/).

These implementations are not particularly clever. They are based on the expository descriptions and pseudo-code I found as I read
about each structure and so are not as fast as possible.

The code is available as a gem: https://rubygems.org/gems/data_structures_rmolinari.

## Usage

The right way to organize the code is not obvious to me. For now the data structures are all defined in the module
`DataStructuresRMolinari` to avoid polluting the global namespace.

Example usage after the gem is installed:
```
require 'data_structures_rmolinari`

# Pull what we need out of the namespace
MaxPrioritySearchTree = DataStructuresRMolinari::MaxPrioritySearchTree
Point = DataStructuresRMolinari::Point # anything responding to :x and :y is fine

pst = MaxPrioritySearchTree.new([Point.new(1, 1)])
puts pst.largest_y_in_ne(0, 0) # "Point(1,1)"
```

## Implementations

### Disjoint Union

We represent a set S of non-negative integers as the disjoint union of subsets. Equivalently, we represent a partition of S. The
data structure provides very efficient implementation of the two key operations
- `unite(e, f)`, which merges the subsets containing e and f; and
- `find(e)`, which returns the canonical representative of the subset containing e. Two elements e and f are in the same subset
  exactly when `find(e) == find(f)`.

It also provides
- `make_set(v)`, add a new value `v` to the set S, starting out in a singleton subset.

For more details see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure and the paper [[TvL1984]](#references) by Tarjan and
van Leeuwen.

### Heap

A binary heap with an `update` method, suitable for use as a priority queue. There are several supported operations:

- `insert(item, priority)`, insert the given item with the stated priority.
  - By default, items must be distinct.
- `top`, returning the element with smallest priority
- `pop`, return the element with smallest priority and remove it from the structure
- `update(item, priority)`, update the priority of the given item, which must already be in the heap

`top` is O(1). The others are O(log n) where n is the number of items in the heap.

By default we have a min-heap: the top element is the one with smallest priority. A configuration parameter at construction can make
it a max-heap.

Another configuration parameter allows the creation of a "non-addressable" heap. This makes it impossible to call `update`, but
allows the insertion of duplicate items (which is sometimes useful) and slightly faster operation overall.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap and the paper by Edelkamp, Elmasry, and Katajainen [[EEK2017]](#references).

### Priority Search Tree

A PST stores a set P of two-dimensional points in a way that allows certain queries about P to be answered efficiently. The data
structure was introduced by McCreight [[McC1985]](#references). De, Maheshawari, Nandy, and Smid [[DMNS2011]](#references) showed
how to build the structure in-place and we use their approach here.

- `largest_y_in_ne(x0, y0)` and `largest_y_in_nw(x0, y0)`, the "highest" (max-y) point in the quadrant to the northest/northwest of
  (x0, y0);
- `smallest_x_in_ne(x0, y0)`, the "leftmost" (min-x) point in the quadrant to the northeast of (x0, y0);
- `largest_x_in_nw(x0, y0)`, the "rightmost" (max-x) point in the quadrant to the northwest of (x0, y0);
- `largest_y_in_3_sided(x0, x1, y0)`, the highest point in the region specified by x0 <= x <= x1 and y0 <= y; and
- `enumerate_3_sided(x0, x1, y0)`, enumerate all the points in that region.

Here compass directions are the natural ones in the x-y plane with the positive x-axis pointing east and the positive y-axis
pointing north.

There is no `smallest_x_in_3_sided(x0, x1, y0)`. Just use `smallest_x_in_ne(x0, y0)`.

The single-point queries run in O(log n) time, where n is the size of P, while `enumerate_3_sided` runs in O(m + log n), where m is
the number of points actually enumerated.

The implementation is in `MaxPrioritySearchTree` (MaxPST for short), so called because internally the structure is, among other
things, a max-heap on the y-coordinates.

These queries appear rather abstract at first but there are interesting applications. See, for example, section 4 of
[[McC85]](#references), keeping in mind that the data structure in that paper is actually a _MinPST_.

We also provide a `MinPrioritySearchTree`, which answers analagous queries in the southward-infinite quadrants and 3-sided
regions.

In [[DMNS2013]](#reference) De et al. generalize the in-place structure to a _Min-max Priority Search Tree_ (MinmaxPST) that can
answer queries in all four quadrants and both "kinds" of 3-sided boxes. Having one of these would save the trouble of constructing
both a MaxPST and MinPST. But the presentiation is hard to follow in places and the paper's pseudocode is buggy.[^minmaxpst]

### Segment Tree

Segment trees store information related to subintervals of a certain array. For example, they can be used to find the sum of the
elements in an arbitrary subinterval A[i..j] of an array A[0..n] in O(log n) time. Each node in the tree corresponds to a subarray
of A in such a way that the values we store in the nodes can be combined efficiently to determined the desired result for arbitrary
subarrays.

An excellent description of the idea is found at https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html.

Generic code is provided in `SegmentTreeTemplate`. Concrete classes are written by providing a handful of simple lambdas and
constants to the template class's initializer. For now we provide the concrete classes `MaxValSegmentTree` and
`IndexOfMaxValSegmentTree`. Figuring out the details requires some knowledge of the internal mechanisms of a segment tree, for which
the link at cp-algorithms.com is very helpful. See the definitions of the concrete classes for examples.
