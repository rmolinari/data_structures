# Data Structures

This is a small collection of Ruby data structures that I have implemented for my own sake. Implementing the code for a data
structure is almost always more educational than simply reading about it and is usually fun.

These implementations are not particularly clever and are probably slow. They are based on the expository descriptions and
pseudo-code I found as I read about each structure and so are unlikely to be as fast as possible.

Documentation is a work in progress.

## Priority Search Tree

Store a set of two-dimensional points in the place that allows certain queries to be answered efficiently. See McCreight and De et al.
